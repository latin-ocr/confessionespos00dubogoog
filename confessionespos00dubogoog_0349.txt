PLAN OF THE WORK.

l. The subjecta of the several treatises to be published shall mainly be, Doctrine‚
Praetice, Exposition of Holy Scriptura, Refutation of Heresy, or History.

2. The treatiaes shall be published entire, so as to form a whole.

3. The notices of the respective Fathers shall be confined to such brief accounts of
them (mostly taken from ancient sources) as shall put the general reader in possession
of their age, character, and the like.

4. The notes shall be limited to the explanation of obscure passages, or references,
or to the removal of any misapprehension which might not improbably arise (after the
manner of the Benedictines).

5. The best editions shall be procured for the Translators.

6. Each volume shall consist either of a work or works of a single Father, or of those
of several Fathers upon the same subject, or connected subjeets, as in selections of
Homilies.

7. Each volume (or at most two volumes) shall form a whole in itself3 but the
volumes shall be continued uniform‚ so that those who wish for hiller sets, may ba able
to obtain them. Each volume to contain from 400 to 600 pages.

8. The Editors hold themselves responsible for the selection of the several treatises
to be translated, as also for the faithfulness of the translations; they will, however,
thankfuny receive any hints upon the subject, especially from divines, or their ecele-
siastical superiors.

9. The work shall be published in closely printed 8vo volumes; and with as much
attention to cheapness as is consistent with the good execution of the work, and the
necessary remuneration of the Translators and Booksellers.

10. 'ste Editors have assented to the suggestion of the Publishers, that the work
should be published by subscription, in the hope that its price may thereby be consi-
derably reduced, in consequence of the increased number of copies printed. The Editor:
deelining all pecuniary profit, that arising from the additional copies printed, will go to
the reduction of the price of the whole. lt must, however, be distinctly understood,
that the Editor-s hold themselves under no responsibility to the Subscribers, as such,
with regard to the choice of the works to be translated.

11. The originals of the works translated shall be printed, either at once or subse-
quently, if this shall appear desirable. It would be well, therefore, if Subscribers would
specify, if they wish for the originals, either with or without the translations.

12. 1t is understood that subscriptions continue, until it be intimated that they are
discontinued, and that they extend, under ordinary circumstances, to ,the end os each
year. It will be arranged, however, that the works of each year should form a whole;
so that the subscription might be broken off without inconvenience to the Subscriber.

13. Subscriptions might be confined, if desired, to certain larger works (as st. Chry-
sostom on the Epistles of St. Paul), but this obviously would be too complicated to be
extended to works os small compass.

14. Four volumes are to appear in each year: the price to Subscribers not to στερεά
9³. for a closely printed 8vo of 400 pages ς to the public it will be raised one-fourth.
When old 'lh-ahslations are revised, the price will be diminished.

15. No volume can be subscr-iberi sor after it is publiano& but the Subscription Εἰσί

remeius opensor the fiatur-e volumes.
