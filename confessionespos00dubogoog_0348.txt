much will not be so mature as, on these subjecte, is especially to be desired.
Our occupatione do not leave time sor mature thought.

4. Every body of Christiane has a peculiar character, which tends to
make them look upon the system of saith, committed to us, on a particular
side; and so, if they carry it on by themselves, they insensibly contract its
limits and depth, and virtually lose a great deal of what they think that
they hold. While the system of the Church, as expressed by her Creeds
and Liturgy, remains the same, that of her members will gradually become
contracted and shallow, unless continually enlarged and refreshed. In
ancient times this tendency was remedied by the constant living intercourse
between the several branches of the Catholic Church, by the circulation of
the writings of the Fathers of the several Churches, and, in part, by the
present method--translation. We virtually acknowledge the necessity of
such accessione by our importations from Ger-many and America3 but the
circumstances of Germany render mere translation unadvisable, and most
of the American Theology proceeds from bodies who have altered the doc-
trine of the Sacramenta.

5. The peculiar advantages of the Fathers in resisting heretical errors,
in that they had to combat the errors in their original form, before men’s
minds were familiarized with them, and so risked pai-taking of them 3 and
also in that they lived nearer to the Apostles·

6. The great comfort of being able to produce, out of Christian antiquity,
refutations of heresy, (such as the different shades of the Arian z) thereby
avoiding the necessity of discussing, ourselveS, profane errors, which, on so
high mysteries, cannot be handled without pain, and rarely without injury
to our own minds.

7. The advantage which some of the Fathers (e. g. St. Chrysostom) ,
possessed as Commentators on the New Testament, from speaking its lan· ,
gagga-rho value of having an ocular testimony of the existence of Catholic ᾗ
verity‚ and Catholic agreement3 that truth is not merely what a man
tromeda,- that the Church once was one, and spake one language3 and ¹
that the present unhappy divisione are not necessary and unavoidable.

9. The circumstance that the Anglican branch of the Cburch Catholic
is founded upon Holy Scripture and the agreement os the Universal Chul-ch: .
and that therefore the knowledge of Christian antiquity is necessary in
order to Iunderstand and maintain her doctrines, and especially her Creeds
and her itur .

10. The imgrtance, at the present crisis, of exhibiting the real practica] Ι
value of Catholic Antiquity, which is disparaged by Romanists in order to
make way for the later couneus, and by others in behalf of modern and
private interpretatione of Holy Scripture. The character of Catholic anti-
quity, and of the scheme of salvadeu, as set forth therein, cannot be ap-

preciated through the broken sentences of the Fathers, which men pick up
out of controversia] divinity.

11. The great danger in which Romanists are of lapsing into secret infi-
delity, not seeing how to escape from the palpable errors of their own
Church, without falling into the opposite errors of Ultra-Protestants. It

free from the errors, alike of modern Rome and ef Ultra-protestantism’.

12. Gratitude to Anmonrt Gon, who has raised up these great lights
in the Church of Christ, and set them there sor its benefit inall times.
